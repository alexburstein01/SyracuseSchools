        <p> Nicole Fonger has a lot of hope for the Syracuse City School District (SCSD). A current associate professor of mathematics education at Syracuse University, Fonger enrolled her kids in SCSD in 2017.</p>

        <p>Five years later, the district faced retirement from its superintendent Jaime Alecia. In stepped <a href="https://www.syracusecityschools.com/districtpage.cfm?pageid=533" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Anthony Davis</a>. An alum of the district himself, he was quoted <a href="https://www.syracusecityschools.com/districtpage.cfm?pageid=12886" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">early on</a> saying, “I fully understand the challenges facing our students.” And Fonger feels the urgency.</p>

        <p> “I get text messages from the district, if not weekly, monthly on community activities where they're bringing the joy and the fun in mathematics,” <a href="https://soe.syr.edu/about/directory/nicole-fonger/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">said Fonger</a>, who has studied math equity for nearly 20 years.</p>

        <p>Davis has rethought academics. But numbers show there’s still a while to go.</p>

        <p>Public school education is supposed to help provide an even playing field for all kids growing up. Yet my new analysis of the most recent data from Syracuse City School District elementary schools and districts around the state in the 2022-23 school year shows this is far from the case. Statistics from more recent years are not compiled yet.</p>

        <p>Even within Syracuse, the analysis found disparities, with access to quality elementary schools varying by quadrants and “selective enrollment” schools often performing better than other public Syracuse schools. </p>

        <p>When the district is put together as a whole, it lags severely behind state averages in English language arts (ELA) and math proficiency, as well as student spending and teacher experience.</p>

        <p> Across the nation, selective enrollment schools offer certain students the option to attend a different public school than in their neighborhood, often with specialized programs and in turn advanced academics. While Syracuse only has three selective enrollment elementary schools, the pattern holds the same in SCSD.</p>

        <p>In both third through eighth grade math and ELA proficiency, selective enrollment schools had the highest average proficiency rates. The rest of the quadrants went in the same order of east, north, south and then west. This shows a correlation between location and student success.</p>

        <p> The fact that math and ELA proficiencies are ranked in the same way doesn’t surprise Fonger, due to a link between the two core subjects.</p>

        <p>“If you haven't supported young learners to read, then it also confounds and makes it super complex to support mathematics learning, where you're also required to read,” Fonger said.</p>

        <p><iframe title="Syracuse City School District elementary math and ELA proficiency percentage (Grade 3-8) by quadrant" aria-label="Stacked Bars" id="datawrapper-chart-zRxgs" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/zRxgs/4/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="334" data-external="1"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var t in a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<e.length;r++)if(e[r].contentWindow===a.source){var i=a.data["datawrapper-height"][t]+"px";e[r].style.height=i}}}))}();
</script></p>

        <p>However, the current division between selection enrollment and other schools isn’t likely to change. <a href="https://www.syracuse.com/news/2023/12/take-a-peek-inside-syracuses-proposed-75-million-steam-high-school-see-images.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A $75 million STEAM high school</a> is in the development stages. The school is aimed at helping kids prepare for specific careers in science, technology, engineering, arts and mathematics, fields that often have high-paying careers. However, that specific education will only be available for students in the school, not district-wide.</p>


        <p>In trying to create an equitable learning environment, these gaps by area would be removed in the SCSD. </p>

        <p>While the type of school was an indicator of success, the same can not be said about a school and how much it spends on each student. In data from the 2022-23 school year, Expeditionary Learning Middle School had the highest expenditures per pupil and the second-highest average proficiency rate.</p>

        <p>But, the rest of the numbers are jumbled. There is no clear sign with the rest of the data that there is any direct relationship in Syracuse between expenditures and test success.</p>

        <p>Despite all schools being in the same district, expenditures on each student per average in a school can range from $13,000 to $23,000, a huge gap. While this might not be seen directly in the tests, this can affect other areas of a student’s experiences, like access to food and after-school activities.</p>

        <p>Those are concerning numbers in the district. But a look at the overall SCSD numbers compared to state averages shows an even larger gap. The district employs 14% more teachers teaching out of their certifications and 8% more inexperienced teachers than the state average.</p>

        <p>The district also spends over $9000 less on expenditures per pupil on average, while math proficiency is 37% below average and ELA proficiency is 30% below average. These numbers show huge gaps between the district and state in several key areas.</p>

        <p><iframe title="Syracuse City School District averages vs. New York state averages" aria-label="Split Bars" id="datawrapper-chart-HozDE" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/HozDE/4/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="180" data-external="1"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var t in a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<e.length;r++)if(e[r].contentWindow===a.source){var i=a.data["datawrapper-height"][t]+"px";e[r].style.height=i}}}))}();</script></p>

        <p>So where does SCSD go from here? There are several areas to tackle. The district has battled chronic absenteeism in recent years, which can have a direct impact on kids' grades.</p>

        <p>In the past two school years, nearly half of the student body was chronically absent. Before the first day of classes this school year, Davis <a href="https://www.wrvo.org/education/2024-09-05/syracuse-city-school-district-starts-new-school-year-trying-to-tackle-chronic-absenteeism" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">told WRVO Public Radio</a> that the solution starts at a young age.</p>

        <p>“Kindergarten is probably the biggest part of the problem and then you start to create those habits,” Davis said.</p>

        <p>Additionally, the state has a new focus on reading, but this could leave math problems in students even further behind.</p>

        <p>Fonger sees the solution as four-pronged. The best research model she’s found for educational equity, especially in mathematics, comes from <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/289822394_Context_Matters_How_Should_We_Conceptualize_Equity_in_Mathematics_Education" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rochelle Gutierrez</a>. The solution is based on the intersection of four dimensions — identity, achievement, power and access.</p>

        <p>“Gutierrez is framing where equity is defined as both supporting learners to see themselves as competent mathematics doers and knowers,” Fonger said.</p>

        <p>Part of this, Fogner acknowledged, does come from structural inquiries - wealth, healthcare, class and more. That helps explain the low proficiency numbers across the board for SCSD. But there are signs of progress.</p>

        <p>The current data only reflects the first year of leadership for Davis. That means policies to improve equity were just starting to take effect.  A better future for the district is possible, according to Fonger, with all hands on deck.</p>

        <p>“It has to be both in school and out of school, Fonger said. “You have to engage families. This is not something that only teachers can ‘fix.’ It's everyone together.”</p>
